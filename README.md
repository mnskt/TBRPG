# TBRPG

TBRPG, in other words, text based role-playing game. I recently played Lifeline game on android and thought to myself -- "hey, I want to make such a game myself". A simple, text based RPG game, that would not only expand my programming skills in OOP programming, but also would give me something to do instead of playing video games after work.

My expectation is to learn how to use classes, functions, lamba and use for and while loops efficiently.

So here we are.

A beginner's way to intermediate through making a game.
